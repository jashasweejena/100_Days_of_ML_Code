# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 5, 2018 

  * 10:58PM IST

**Today's Progress**: Modify this repo to my taste.

**Thoughts:** I really hope to stay motivated on the course of this journey of 100days (A.K.A. 100 Hours). Updates on twitter and here. Will create a repo if needed. Follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/imjasj)

**Link to work:** Really none! Will start from tomorrow.


### Day 1: July 6, 2018 

  * 5:45PM IST - Plan for today

**Today's Progress**: Learn some basic javascript and some basics from The Deep Learning Book.

**Thoughts:** I worked for about 2 odd hours today. I started by thinking that javascript is much easier to use because I had some background working with basic java. But boy was I wrong! It took me about 40 odd minutes to grasp some of the basics like, functions are integral to js, objects are defined in a way different to other OOPS based languages. Then the rest of the 20 mins passed away in making sense of what a tree is actually and how "this" keyword works in javascript. One hour had already passed by the time this finished. I took a break of 15 mins and started with "The Deep Learning Book" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville. It went on for about an hour. I retired then.

**Link to work:** Really none! Though, you can see the images I posted above.


### Day 2: July 7, 2018 

  * 7:55PM IST - Completed Day 2

       ![page1day2](https://github.com/jashasweejena/100_Days_of_ML_Code/raw/master/Day2/Day2_1.jpeg)

**Today's Progress**: Setup anaconda and learn a bit about how lists are made in python by using a dataset from Quandl.

**Thoughts:** I didn't do much today. Was stuck coz my global python environment was not changing from miniconda to anaconda(recently installed!). I did solve that, then I took some time grasping how lists work with python and they are amazing. Python does a better job at managing lists than java does with managing ArrayLists. That's it for today!

### Day 3: July 8, 2018 

  * 6:38PM IST - Completed Day 3

       ![page1day3](https://github.com/jashasweejena/100_Days_of_ML_Code/raw/master/Day3/Day3_1.jpeg)

**Today's Progress**: Learnt more about python, including topics like lists, tuples, generator, for loop, while loop, writing functions. Learnt about pandas and how it uses something like a dataframe to manage datasets. Learn't some very basic operations on dataframes.

**Thoughts:** I didn't do much today as well. Pandas took some time getting used to and I guess, python will take some getting used to as well. I didn't know that the datasets we talk about in machine learning have the same layout as an excel sheet. It is pretty interesting stuff! Pandas is nice. Plan on doing more progress next time!

**Link to work:** None! Coz, I didn't work on any project. Sorry.


### Day 4: July 9, 2018 

  * 7:32PM IST - Completed Day 4

       ![page1day4](https://github.com/jashasweejena/100_Days_of_ML_Code/raw/master/Day4/day4_1.jpeg)

**Today's Progress**: Learn about vector and matrix multiplication and some more function of pandas.

**Thoughts:** Today I was tired af! But I know that it isn't an excuse. Still, I felt like my brain couldn't process even simple math. So, after watching 17 mins of a 45 min long video of MIT OCW, I gave up. I switched to completing the 'pandas basics' video from where I left off yesterday. Did complete that tho! Tried watching some 3B1B too, but brain says to sleep. So that's what I'm gonna do.

**Link to work:** None! Coz, I didn't work on any project. Sorry.


### Day 5: July 10, 2018 

  * 11:42PM IST - Completed Day 5


**Today's Progress**: Learned about training a classifier, predicting accuracy of a classifier, splitting the dataset into training and testing data, converting a (part of) dataframe to an array using numpy.

**Thoughts:** Today I was tired af too! Hope, I get over this soon. Besides, no pictures for today coz I didn't pen anything down today as everything was happening in code. I was watching sentdex's videos and following along.

### Day 6: July 11, 2018 

  * 9:38PM IST - Completed Day 6


**Today's Progress**: Nothing much! First I started with sentdex's videos of which I wasn't unable to understand a part. Then, I sat down to see 3b1b's neural network series' first video. 

**Thoughts:** Today I was tired af too coz college started. I haven't slept well since 3 days. I think, I should work with python, math and other stuffs from the basic level before I jump into ML. 

**Link to work:** None


### Day 7: July 12, 2018 

  * 8:50PM IST - Completed Day 7

       ![page1day4](https://github.com/jashasweejena/100_Days_of_ML_Code/raw/master/Day7/day7_1.jpeg)

**Today's Progress**: Started "Math of Intelligence - Siraj Raval" and watched a video of the Coding Train teaching elementary calculus. Then, switched over to Andrew Ng's course for an intro to what is about to come my way. 

**Thoughts:** College has a way of making us tired, and that coupled with only 4-5 hours of sleep at night = dizziness everywhere in the day. And, trying to wrap your head around complex math concepts while being sleep deprived is a nightmare. I just learnt it the hard way that one must learn to walk before running. So, I've got to make my math my strongest subject. I've to work hard. Whenever I find time in college or in my daily life, I gotta study math. Okay!

### Day 8: July 13, 2018 

  * 8:00PM IST - Completed Day 8

**Today's Progress**: Watched two videos of 3B1B'S essence of calculus series. They helped me build intuition for some of the problems and paradoxes in calculus and how to get around them.

**Thoughts:** I am tired of telling that I'm tired. Firstly, I figured that I must learn to walk before I run, so I'm starting to ignite my hidden interest in math to help me propel forward. Calculus still intrigues me and will continue to do so for the rest of my life, but I gotta get around it. And I will.
