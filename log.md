  * 10:58PM IST

**Today's Progress**: Modify this repo to my taste.

**Thoughts:** I really hope to stay motivated on the course of this journey of 100days (A.K.A. 100 Hours). Updates on twitter and here. Will create a repo if needed. Follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/imjasj)

**Link to work:** Really none! Will start from tomorrow.

**Today's Progress**: Learn some basic javascript and some basics from The Deep Learning Book.

**Thoughts:** I worked for about 2 odd hours today. I started by thinking that javascript is much easier to use because I had some background working with basic java. But boy was I wrong! It took me about 40 odd minutes to grasp some of the basics like, functions are integral to js, objects are defined in a way different to other OOPS based languages. Then the rest of the 20 mins passed away in making sense of what a tree is actually and how "this" keyword works in javascript. One hour had already passed by the time this finished. I took a break of 15 mins and started with "The Deep Learning Book" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville. It went on for about an hour. I retired then.

**Link to work:** Really none! Though, you can see the images I posted above.


### Day 2: July 7, 2018 

  * 7:55PM IST - Completed Day 2

       ![page1day2](https://github.com/jashasweejena/100_Days_of_ML_Code/raw/master/Day2/Day2_1.jpeg)

**Today's Progress**: Setup anaconda and learn a bit about how lists are made in python by using a dataset from Quandl.

**Thoughts:** I didn't do much today. Was stuck coz my global python environment was not changing from miniconda to anaconda(recently installed!). I did solve that, then I took some time grasping how lists work with python and they are amazing. Python does a better job at managing lists than java does with managing ArrayLists. That's it for today!

### Day 3: July 8, 2018 

  * 6:38PM IST - Completed Day 3

       ![page1day3](https://github.com/jashasweejena/100_Days_of_ML_Code/raw/master/Day3/Day3_1.jpeg)

**Today's Progress**: Learnt more about python, including topics like lists, tuples, generator, for loop, while loop, writing functions. Learnt about pandas and how it uses something like a dataframe to manage datasets. Learn't some very basic operations on dataframes.

**Thoughts:** I didn't do much today as well. Pandas took some time getting used to and I guess, python will take some getting used to as well. I didn't know that the datasets we talk about in machine learning have the same layout as an excel sheet. It is pretty interesting stuff! Pandas is nice. Plan on doing more progress next time!

**Link to work:** None! Coz, I didn't work on any project. Sorry.


### Day 4: July 9, 2018 

  * 7:32PM IST - Completed Day 4

       ![page1day4](https://github.com/jashasweejena/100_Days_of_ML_Code/raw/master/Day4/day4_1.jpeg)

**Today's Progress**: Learn about vector and matrix multiplication and some more function of pandas.

**Thoughts:** Today I was tired af! But I know that it isn't an excuse. Still, I felt like my brain couldn't process even simple math. So, after watching 17 mins of a 45 min long video of MIT OCW, I gave up. I switched to completing the 'pandas basics' video from where I left off yesterday. Did complete that tho! Tried watching some 3B1B too, but brain says to sleep. So that's what I'm gonna do.

**Link to work:** None! Coz, I didn't work on any project. Sorry.


### Day 5: July 10, 2018 

  * 11:42PM IST - Completed Day 5


**Today's Progress**: Learned about training a classifier, predicting accuracy of a classifier, splitting the dataset into training and testing data, converting a (part of) dataframe to an array using numpy.

**Thoughts:** Today I was tired af too! Hope, I get over this soon. Besides, no pictures for today coz I didn't pen anything down today as everything was happening in code. I was watching sentdex's videos and following along.

### Day 6: July 11, 2018 

  * 9:38PM IST - Completed Day 6


**Today's Progress**: Nothing much! First I started with sentdex's videos of which I wasn't unable to understand a part. Then, I sat down to see 3b1b's neural network series' first video. 

**Thoughts:** Today I was tired af too coz college started. I haven't slept well since 3 days. I think, I should work with python, math and other stuffs from the basic level before I jump into ML. 

**Link to work:** None


### Day 7: July 12, 2018 

  * 8:50PM IST - Completed Day 7

       ![page1day4](https://github.com/jashasweejena/100_Days_of_ML_Code/raw/master/Day7/day7_1.jpeg)

**Today's Progress**: Started "Math of Intelligence - Siraj Raval" and watched a video of the Coding Train teaching elementary calculus. Then, switched over to Andrew Ng's course for an intro to what is about to come my way. 

**Thoughts:** College has a way of making us tired, and that coupled with only 4-5 hours of sleep at night = dizziness everywhere in the day. And, trying to wrap your head around complex math concepts while being sleep deprived is a nightmare. I just learnt it the hard way that one must learn to walk before running. So, I've got to make my math my strongest subject. I've to work hard. Whenever I find time in college or in my daily life, I gotta study math. Okay!

**Link to work:** None


### Day 8: July 13, 2018 

  * 8:00PM IST - Completed Day 8

**Today's Progress**: Watched two videos of 3B1B'S essence of calculus series. They helped me build intuition for some of the problems and paradoxes in calculus and how to get around them.

**Thoughts:** I am tired of telling that I'm tired. Firstly, I figured that I must learn to walk before I run, so I'm starting to ignite my hidden interest in math to help me propel forward. Calculus still intrigues me and will continue to do so for the rest of my life, but I gotta get around it. And I will.

**Link to work:** None


### Day 9: July 13, 2018 

  * 8:00PM IST - Completed Day 9

**Today's Progress**: Watched Siraj Raval's Episode 2 of The Math Of Intelligence and learnt a bit about support vector machines.

**Thoughts:** I am not tired today! I was just actively lazy and procrastinative. I learnt that I must learn about math properly first before getting down to code. I'm doing that

**Link to work:** None


### Day 10: July 14, 2018 

  * 9:00PM IST - Completed Day 10

**Today's Progress**: Started watching "Intro to Data Analysis" from Udacity and started at codewars

**Thoughts:** I am not tired today! I was just actively lazy and procrastinative. I learnt that I must learn about math properly first before getting down to code. I'm doing that. Being lazy here too.

**Link to work:** None


### Day 11: July 16, 2018 

  * (No Time) IST - Completed Day 11

**Today's Progress**: Most of my python basics are clear and I'm all ready to go!

**Thoughts:** Bought ML course from LearnCodeOnline and I now have a clear pathway to go. Python's basics are easy af and I don't feel fatigued today somehow. Hope to do something great tomorrow!

**Link to work:** None


### Day 12: July 17, 2018 

  * (No Time) IST - Completed Day 12

**Today's Progress**: Gained more familiarity with python. Wrote a simple bubble sorting loop and started learning some basic web scraping.

**Thoughts:** Today doesn't feel tiresome, yet I started a little late at 9PM. I started with some simple python progs from LCO and I feel confident.

**Link to work:** None


### Day 13: July 18, 2018 

  * (No Time) IST - Completed Day 13

**Today's Progress**: Scraped wikipedia for some simple titles (based on Hitesh's video) and learn't a bit more about numpy

**Thoughts:** Learnt some more about numpy and scraped Wikipedia

**Link to work:** None


### Day 14: July 19, 2018 

  * (No Time) IST - Completed Day 14

**Today's Progress**: Almost completed the numpy section of LCO.

**Thoughts:** Numpy is powerful af. It can design matrices, perform operations on them and a whole lot of things on them. I almost completed the numpy section and am planning to complete the last remaining video too. Tomorrow onwards, I'm gonna focus on the math part throughout my day and use pen and paper to solve math problems.

**Link to work:** None


### Day 15: July 20, 2018 

  * (No Time) IST - Completed Day 15

**Today's Progress**: Numpy, done! Pandas, reached middle part.

**Thoughts:** Pandas is used for data preprocessing, as far as I know. Learning pandas, and I kinda hope about completing that section tomorrow and that's it.

**Link to work:** None


### Day 16: July 21, 2018 

  * (No Time) IST - Completed Day 16

**Today's Progress**: Pandas, done! Nice library.

**Thoughts:** Didn't do much today, just completed pandas part of LCO. It is quite flexible in handling datasets. That's it for today.

**Link to work:** None


### Day 17: July 22, 2018 

  * (No Time) IST - Completed Day 17

**Today's Progress**: Matplotlib, done!

**Thoughts:** Didn't do much today either, but really enjoyed the part that I did. Learning about these libraries solely can be boring at times when you don't really see the end goal and all you see are the naive self-made databases and those seemingly simple operations that we apply on it But once this occurs, think of the time when you need to study basic geometry in lower classes to understand advanced topics like calculus once you grow up. 

**Link to work:** None


### Day 18: July 22, 2018 

  * (No Time) IST - Completed Day 18

**Today's Progress**: Seaborn, almost done. Apart from that, read a few pages of the deeplearning book and things are becoming a bit less hazy now.

**Thoughts:** Internet was down so I had to wait and wait until I settled down to read the pdf of the deeplearningbook. I learned a bit about how representations matter while doing any task and how representation learning might help in that regard. Deep learning is a kind of representation learning which in turn comes under the domain of machine learning and all of the above can be regarded as components of AI. I learned about what is deep learning based on. Deep learning is based on building complex representations based on simpler representations coz representation learning outside deep learning is complicated AF. A simple example of a model which implements representation learning is a MLP(Multi Layered Perceptron) which is an autoencoder, i.e. a thing which encodes data into a certain representation and decodes the representation into the original data ensuring minimal loss to the original data. Also, learned about factorplot and peering over the top, it seems useful AF. GoodBye, coz I gotta change the world . xD

### Day 19: July 23, 2018 

  * (No Time) IST - Completed Day 19

**Today's Progress**: Did learn about a new type of plot A.K.A. swarmplot which is a variation of a scatterplot so that different points don't overlap. Also, learn't about a hell lot of functions in pandas mostly while doing a simple data analysis on a pre-made 911 calls dataset. 

**Thoughts:** Did perform swarmplot on some parameters from the 'iris' dataset which I used 'seaborn' to load. Swarmplot, an advanced form of a scatterplot. Used a pre-made 911 calls dataset to perform various operations such as checking the frequency of various types of reasons for a 911 call, telling the number of unique reasons, using the apply function of pandas to apply a single operation(function) to a column and using that did things like converting an 'object' to a 'timeStamp' object so that operations specific to timeStamps can be done. Even, converted 'timeStamp' object to a string to extract day, date, etc. from that and no sooner that I did that, I realised that there was an exclusive array of operations(functions) which could do the same. Also ran a countplot on some data.

### Day 20: July 24, 2018 

  * (No Time) IST - Completed Day 20

**Today's Progress**: Learn't a bit about independent and dependent matrices and using groupby method to group data and use .plot method to plot graphs on grouped parameters. Also, learnt a way to customize the position of legend on the graph. 

**Thoughts:** Didn't do much today. Started off with some history of ML and DL from a book and moved onto arranging the earlier 911 dataset via groupby operations and learn't a bit about independent and dependent matrices.

**Link to work:** None!


### Day 21: July 26, 2018 

  * (No Time) IST - Completed Day 21

**Today's Progress**: Worked on some things. Learnt about independent and dependent matrices. Removed NaN using imputer from sci-kit learn. Used a LabelEncoder to convert the textual categorical data to numbers, used OneHotEncoder to convert the data into a dummy matrix, then split the data into training and testing datasets and scaled each one of the training and testing datasets(X only).

**Thoughts:** Data analysis is basically what I did today. I took a dataset, removed NaN values, used a LabelEncoder on it, converted the encoded values to a dummy matrix, split the dataset into training and testing dataset and scaled it using standard deviation. Not a lot of things, but better than yesterday.

### Day 22: July 27, 2018 

  * (No Time) IST - Completed Day 22

**Today's Progress**: Worked on some more things in linear regression. Completed a simple portfolio project which uses a dataset consisting of house prices and other variables. I used sqft to predict house prices and plotted a graph depicting how good the regressor was at classifying house prices.

**Thoughts:** Understood linear regression somewhat. It is a technique used to predict some dependent value from some independent value(that is exactly what supervised learning intends to do). Linear regression is special in a way that if we try to use a scatterplot to plot the initial points then linear regression, as the name suggests, can try to fit a line so that it is closest to as many data points as possible and the best part, you can actually see your data points and your line traversing through those points. Though it is just 4 lines of code when we use a library like sci-kit learn but I intend on going into the math part soon AF.

### Day 23: July 28, 2018 

  * (No Time) IST - Completed Day 23

**Today's Progress**: Learned decision tree and used it to predict the marks secured by a specified person given his/her study hours. Learned K-Nearest Neighbor a bit(just the theoretical part).

**Thoughts:** Understood decision tree kinda and used scikit learn to predict a result based on some input. I feel, linear regression, KNN, Decision Trees (and prolly Naive Bayes and SVMs) do the same job, i.e. take an input and predict an output. Different algorithms, yet same objective. That's all I learned today.
