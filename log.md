**Today's Progress**: Learn some basic javascript and some basics from The Deep Learning Book.

**Thoughts:** I worked for about 2 odd hours today. I started by thinking that javascript is much easier to use because I had some background working with basic java. But boy was I wrong! It took me about 40 odd minutes to grasp some of the basics like, functions are integral to js, objects are defined in a way different to other OOPS based languages. Then the rest of the 20 mins passed away in making sense of what a tree is actually and how "this" keyword works in javascript. One hour had already passed by the time this finished. I took a break of 15 mins and started with "The Deep Learning Book" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville. It went on for about an hour. I retired then.

**Link to work:** Really none! Though, you can see the images I posted above.
